# DATA-WAREHOUSING-AND-DATA-MINING
 To introduce the concepts of data  warehouse and data mining, which gives a complete description about the principles, used,  architectures, applications, design and implementation of data mining and data ware housing  concepts.

Data Warehouse and OLAP Technology: An Overview: Data Warehouse, A Multidimensional 
Data Model, Data Warehouse Architecture, Data Warehouse Implementation, From Data 
Warehousing to Data Mining. (Han &Kamber)

Data Mining: Introduction, Data Mining, Motivating challenges, The origins of Data Mining, 
Data Mining Tasks, Types of Data, Data Quality.
Data Preprocessing: Aggregation, Sampling, Dimensionality Reduction, Feature Subset 
Selection, Feature creation, Discretization and Binarization, Variable Transformation, Measures 
of Similarity and Dissimilarity. (Tan &Vipin)

Classification: Basic Concepts, General Approach to solving a classification problem, Decision 
Tree Induction: Working of Decision Tree, building a decision tree, methods for expressing an 
attribute test conditions, measures for selecting the best split, Algorithm for decision tree 
induction.

Model Overfitting: Due to presence of noise, due to lack of representation samples, evaluating 
the performance of classifier: holdout method, random sub sampling, cross-validation, bootstrap.
